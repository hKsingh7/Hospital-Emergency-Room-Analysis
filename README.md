# Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard

This Power BI dashboard offers an interactive visualization of hospital emergency room operations, focusing on patient analytics, operational trends, and resource optimization. Built for hospital administrators and healthcare analysts, it delivers actionable insights into performance and service quality across different periods.

## Overview

The dashboard enables users to monitor patient flow, operational efficiency, and patient satisfaction by consolidating data from multiple sources. With easy-to-navigate pages for monthly, consolidated, and individual patient details, it empowers data-driven management and targeted improvements.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- **Total Number of Patients:** Tracks the volume of ER visits over time for workload analysis.
- **Average Wait Time:** Measures typical patient wait durations, helping identify bottlenecks and service delays.
- **Patient Satisfaction Score:** Aggregates patient feedback (e.g. on a 0â€“10 scale) to gauge service performance.
- **Number of Patients Referred:** Counts patients sent to other departments, useful for monitoring collaboration or overflow.
- **Admission Status:** Compares numbers or percentages of admitted versus released patients to assist in capacity planning.
- **Wait Time Compliance:** Shows the proportion of patients seen within target wait times.
- **Demographics Breakdown:** Analyzes patient age group, gender, and racial demographics for equity and targeted care strategies.

## Charts and Visualizations

- **Bar Charts:** Illustrate comparisons across categories, such as department referrals, age groups, or gender distribution.
- **Pie/Donut Charts:** Visualize proportions of admission status, patient race, or gender within the ER population.
- **Line Charts:** Show trends for metrics like monthly ER visits, average wait time, or satisfaction score across periods.
- **Stacked Column Charts:** Provide side-by-side analysis (e.g. admissions by department or month, referrals by category).
- **Heatmaps:** Identify peak hours and days (e.g. busiest admission periods), enabling optimal resource allocation and shift planning.
- **Tables:** List detailed records such as patient demographics, visit details, wait time, department involved, and status.
- **KPI Cards:** Present headline figures for core metrics like total patient count, current month's avg wait, or satisfaction at-a-glance.

## Usage

1. Select the desired page (monthly, consolidated, or detailed view) for high-level or granular analytics.
2. Apply filters for year, department, demographic, or outcome to customize insights.
3. Use visualizations to spot bottlenecks, busy periods, or balance resource allocation.
4. Review actionable KPIs and trends to guide improvements in ER service and patient care.
